                        <p class='fw-bold'>3.1. Rationale</p>
                        <p>Our rationale for this observational study was to sample examples of digital communities to construct a typology of digital communities, by uncovering the common and distinguishing characteristics between the variety of digital communities in the wild. Through this typology, we can then discover the factors that contribute to a vibrant and active digital community. 
                        </p>
                        <p class='fw-bold'>3.2. Method</p>
                        <p>Our observational study involved the collection and curation of a list of sharing communities within neighbourhoods that we observed on digital platforms. After this initial data collection, we categorized and analyzed the groups.</p>
                        <p>We conducted our observational study on the digital sharing communities centred within three towns in Singapore: Punggol, Toa Payoh, and Jurong. The reason we chose these towns was due to their estate maturity‚ÄîPunggol is considered a young town, Jurong a middle-aged town, while Toa Payoh is often considered an older town. We compare between these three towns to discover if the maturity of an estate has an effect on digital communities that belong to these estates.</p>
                        <p>Our selection criteria for a digital sharing community to belong to a town informed our search process to discovering these communities online. We consider a digital sharing community to belong to a town if it has one or more of these characteristics:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The community's name includes the town name, or the name of an estate located within the town.</li>
                            <li>Residence in the town is a prerequisite of community membership.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>To discover these digital communities, we used a combination of keyword search and snowball sampling to search for these communities online. The main digital platforms search bars that we used were Facebook, Instagram and Google. We chose these platforms as social media is one of the key platforms of the building of strong communities (<a style="color:black;" id='citation1a' href='#citation1'>Dewi, 2020</a>). We used Microsoft Excel to collect, categorize and process our collected data.</p>
                        <p class='fw-bold'>3.2.1. Keyword Search</p>
                        <p>Keyword searches are defined as a method of searching for information which possess keywords specified by a user, whereby a search term list is applied to a full text index to find documents containing one or more words that are specified by a user (<a style="color:black;" id='citation2a' href='#citation2'>Chen et al, 2020</a>). For our keyword search, we used location names at three levels of place scales we had specified, as well as their combined names:</p>
                        <div class='card-body py-4'>
                            <ul class=' list-group-flush p-0'>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Level 1:</b> Town Name, e.g. "Punggol", "Toa Payoh"</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Level 2:</b> Estate Name, e.g. "Northshore", "Ave 3"</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Level 3:</b> Block Name, e.g. "Blk 42", "512"</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Combinations of the above:</b> e.g. "Punggol Oasis", "Toa Payoh Blk 4"</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>During actual application, additional keywords were added to allow for better searches. These additional keywords aligned with the group purpose, such as ‚Äúgroup buy‚Äù, ‚Äúinterest group‚Äù or ‚ÄúBTO‚Äù. We felt that applying a combination of group place scale coupled with potential group purpose gave better search results in the form of sharing communities that fit our criteria.</p>
                        <p class='fw-bold mt-4'>3.2.2. Snowball Sampling</p>
                        <p>In traditional snowball sampling, researchers ask informants to recommend additional contacts who might be able to contribute to a study, thus partially reflecting the organic structure and development of social networks (<a style="color:black;" id='citation3a' href='#citation3'>Baltar, 2012</a>).</p> 
                        <p>In our research, we used a modified form of snowball sampling in the digital space to reflect the complexities of digital networks recommendations and linked web pages. This took into account sharing communities that were not as discoverable on digital platforms, such as communities with unconventional group names that did not align with our keyword searches.</p>
                        <p>For example, if we entered a group on Telegram and noticed that a user had shared a link to another sharing community in the group, we would click on sent link to see if the suggested group met our criteria (namely a neighbourhood sharing community from either Punggol, Toa Payoh or Jurong that was on a digital platform). If the suggested group met our criteria, we would include it in our observational study.</p>
                        <p>Another instance where snowball sampling came in useful would be a trend that we observed amongst some sharing communities, where the digital presence of these groups straddled multiple platforms. An example was sharing communities based on instagram that included a link in their group description to the shared Whatsapp group where the actual transactions occurred. Namely, Whatsapp was the primary digital basis of interaction, while Instagram was a secondary medium. In these instances, snowball sampling proved useful in enabling us to identify sharing communities that we may not have found solely via keyword searches.</p>

                        <p class='fw-bold mt-4'>3.3.1. Distribution Across Towns</p>
                        <p>In total, we found 81 instances of digital sharing communities between the three towns.</p>
                        <div class='row'>
                            <div class='col-5'>
                                <canvas class="mb-3" id='townDistribution'></canvas>
                            </div>
                            <div class='col'>
                                <p>We observed a positive correlation between the number of digital sharing communities and the maturity of the town, as seen from Figure 1. Namely we observed that the youngest town, Punggol, had the highest number of digital sharing communities (n=37), as compared to middle aged town Jurong (n=26), and old town Toa Payoh (n=18).</p>
                                <p>Given our method of searching, we cannot confirm that these are the exact proportions of sharing communities within each neighbourhood. Rather, we can claim that the sharing communities in younger towns are most easily searchable and found on digital platforms.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>This could be attributed to the higher digital literacy of Punggol residents, given their younger demographic makeup, with 22% of residents aged 30-39 years old, comparing to 13% in Toa Payoh and 14% in Jurong. (<a style="color:black;" id='citation4a' href='#citation4'>Singapore Department of Statistics, 2020</a>) This could also be due to the fact that there is higher focus on digital within newer towns, seen by the focus on developing Punggol as Singapore‚Äôs first digital district (<a style="color:black;" id='citation5a' href='#citation5'>URA, 2020</a>). This aligns with broader goals of Singapore‚Äôs goal to be a globally recognized leading smart city with a strong focus on digital innovation and technology (<a style="color:black;" id='citation6a' href='#citation6'>Yee, 2019</a>). Towns that were more recently redeveloped thus are more intertwined with technology perhaps as compared to older towns, meaning that residents interact with and use technology more in their day to day lives such as the method in which they reach out to like-minded individuals for community creation.</p>
                        <p class='fw-bold mt-4'>3.3.2. Distribution Across Platforms</p>
                        <p>Figure 2 breaks down the sharing communities found in each of the different towns into which platforms the groups were discovered on. The predominant platforms include Whatsapp, Telegram, Instagram and Facebook.</p>
                        <canvas class="mb-3" id='platformDistribution'></canvas>
                        <p>Among the social media platforms, Facebook and Telegram emerge as platforms that best facilitate the discovery of digital sharing communities.  A significant proportion of communities were discovered on Facebook amongst the three towns: Punggol (n=17), Toa Payoh (n=7), and Jurong (n=7).</p>
                        <p>We noted that WhatsApp communities were the least discoverable as the platform does not offer a search function, and entry into the community requires invite links. Only six communities were found from Punggol (n=4), Toa Payoh (n=1), and Jurong (n=1). The communities we did find were found via snowball sampling, as they had promoted their invite links on the other social platforms. We observed that instagram channels were popularly used as platforms for the promotion of invite links to other platforms. This is due to our observation that community accounts on Instagram rarely used the platform for community engagement, and instead used it as an advertising medium to direct people towards their actual community hosted on another social platform.</p>
                        <canvas class="mb-3" id='platformTimeSeries'></canvas>
                        <p>By observing the age of group creation, we can observe a trend in platform preferences. This is seen in Figure 3, where based on the year of creation, Facebook was the popular platform for many initial digital sharing communities from 2008 to 2014. Afterwhich other platforms such as Instagram and Whatsapp came into the picture and more community groups were formed there. We observed that Telegram has been gaining popularity in recent years, as seen from 2017 onwards where the number of communities formed on Telegram rose more as compared to other platforms. </p>
                        
                        <p class='fw-bold mt-4'>3.3.3. Purposes of Digital Sharing Communities</p>
                        <p>The distribution of these different communities across the three towns can be seen in Figure 4. We discovered 5 classifications of purposes of digital sharing communities, which we have classified as: Residential, BTO, Interest Group, Groupbuys and Community Markets.</p>
                        <div class='card-body py-4'>
                            <ul class='list-group-flush p-0'>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Residential:</b> These communities are the most general community, consisting of members from all walks of life, with the common theme of their sharing community being anchored in a physical location within a town residential estate. Generally, members of the communities are residents of the associated place, while topics of discussion within the community are associated with the town/neighbourhood.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>BTO:</b> These communities form when a new BTO site is announced and serves as a common grounds for potential house owners of the site. Hence, while its members might not currently reside in the location, they represent the potential residences of a place.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Interest Groups:</b> These communities are constructed around members sharing a common hobby or activity of interest, while at the same time associated with a place.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Groupbuys:</b> These communities are primarily commerce driven, often of purchasing and collection of groceries and household items. Its members seek to benefit by pooling orders together in order to purchase in bulk at a cheaper price.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Community Markets:</b> These communities are primarily commerce driven, often of the informal purchase and selling of second-hand goods.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>The distribution of these different communities across the three towns can be seen in Figure 5.</p>
                        <canvas class="mb-3" id='purposeDistribution'></canvas>
                        <p>Residential (Punggol, n=14 ; Jurong, n=11 ; Toa Payoh, n=11)  and Groupbuys (Punggol, n=11 ; Jurong, n=7 ; Toa Payoh, n=4) were the most frequent communities observed, a characteristic observed in all three towns. This makes sense as these communities are relevant to the largest proportion of residents, while BTO (Punggol, n=6 ; Jurong, n=2 ; Toa Payoh, n=2)  and Interest Groups (Punggol, n=5 ; Jurong, n=3 ; Toa Payoh, n=4)  communities target a smaller demographic based on the specific common topic of the group.</p>
                        <canvas class="mb-3" id='purposeTimeSeries'></canvas>
                        <p>By looking at when these communities were created along the years, we can also observe that while Residential communities have been around for a while, Groupbuys are a more recent phenomenon, experiencing sharp growth in 2020.</p>
                        <p class='fw-bold mt-4'>3.3.4. Association between Place Specificity and Community Size</p>
                        <p>Place specificity defines the physical boundary of the location associated with the community. We discovered that the communities found could grouped into three levels of place specificity:</p>
                        <div class='card-body py-4'>
                            <ul class=' list-group-flush p-0'>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Estate-level:</b> The smallest sense of place physically, where the community is associated within a block or estate.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Town-level:</b> The community is associated with the town, making no distinction between the estates within the town.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Region-level:</b> The largest sense of place physically, where the community is not just associated with the town, but also extends into its neighbouring towns.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class='row'>
                            <div class='col-6'>
                                <p>When we break down the communities by their place specificity, i.e. the physical bounded location that is associated with the community, we see that Punggol has the highest number of estate-level communitis, while Toa Payoh and Jurong have more town-level communities.</p>
                                <p>One possible reason for this is that the younger demographic of Punggol residents might prefer smaller communities. Small communities are easier to manage and more capable of fostering stronger neighbourly ties.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class='col-6'>
                                <canvas class="mb-3" id='placeSpecificityGroup'></canvas>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class='row'>
                            <div class='col-6'>
                                <canvas class="mb-3" id='placeSpecificityMember'></canvas>
                            </div>
                            <div class='col-6'>
                                <p>However, when we look at the mean size of these communities, it becomes apparent that generally, the size of the community scales as it is associated to a broader location. This makes sense as more residents would identify with the location associated with the community. Hence, region-level communities are able to reach a wider group of people, while estate-level communities are smaller and more diverse.</p>

                        <p class='fw-bold mt-4'>3.3.5. Association between Accessibility and Place Specificity</p>
                        We were also able to categorise our communities by accessibility using 4 categories:
                        <div class='card-body py-4'>
                            <ul class=' list-group-flush p-0'>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Open:</b> Anyone is free to join the community; Non-members are able to see the activities occuring within the community.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Open with Verification:</b> Anyone is able to join the community upon answering a simple question, one usually related to the community's purpose; Non-members are able to see the activities occuring within the community.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Closed with Permission:</b> One needs to seek permission from the manager of the community before allowed into the community. Non-members are unable to see the activities occuring within the community.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Closed with Verification:</b> One needs to produce a verification of their identity and the community's manager verifies that they meet the membership criteria before given membership. Non-members are unable to see the activities occuring within the community.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <canvas class="mb-3" id='accessibilitySpecificity'></canvas>
                        <p>As seen in Figure 8, we find that there are most open communities on town level, though estate has many open communities, it may be thanks to its big cardinality. In addition, Estate level has most communities which are both closed with permission and verification. According to this finding, we can assume that smaller scales are more likely to have closed communities because their social circle may be smaller and more closed.</p>
                        <canvas class="mb-3" id='accessibilitySize'></canvas>
                        <p>The mean size of the communities justifies our previous assumption. We observe that the mean size of open communities on estate level is about half of the closed with verification communities, though there are more open ones. And on town and region levels, we can see a trend that communities in large scale are more likely to open because their target users are in a bigger range and permission or verification will be the restriction to let people join in. In conclusion, the differences in accessibility are mainly related to the groups‚Äô aim and users.</p>
                        <p class='fw-bold mt-4'>3.3.6. Association between Purpose of Community and Organisation Structure</p>
                        <canvas class="mb-3" id='purposeOrg'></canvas>
                        <p>The types of organization also implicates the characteristics of a particular community. We categorised our communities into  3 categories by types of organization:</p>
                        <div class='card-body py-4'>
                            <ul class=' list-group-flush p-0'>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Flat Hierarchy:</b> Anyone within the community is able to interact with the others.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>Hierarchical:</b> The admin has the right to post messages to the whole community while the members‚Äô messages will be only sent to the admin. E.g Groupbuy communities.</li>
                                <li class='list-group-item'><b>One-Way:</b> Only the admin can post messages within the community. The other members only have the right to accept information.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>We can easily see the effect of type of organization on the choice on platform and the purpose of the communities. For different purposes they have different preferences of interactions, BTO and Interest Group Communities have more open discussions, while Groupbuys and Resident Communities are more like announcement channels. Additionally, most of the communities have flat hierarchy organization possibly because they want to encourage interactions among the members, which can have an effect on enhancing the social cohesion.</p>

                        <p>Based on environmental study, we want to get a deeper understanding on how the group members interact with the digital communities. So we select six BTO and Residential groups (two for each town) to do further social network analysis.(need be detailed).</p>
                        <p>The criteria for the 6 selected groups is as following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open groups that are:</li>
                            <li>Still active and/or
                                <ul><li>We definite active as having at least 20 interactions in the past month. (e.g. posting, messaging, commenting)</li></ul></li>
                            <li>Selection with a preference of large > medium > small Communities.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The selected groups can be seen in Figure 11.</p>
